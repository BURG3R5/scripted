# scripted

**A game about words.**

## an experience not meant for humans

This game is not meant for humans. Do not [play](https://burg3r5.itch.io/scripted) it. It will not
care about your experience.

### a note from the developer

In order to avoid getting stuck in development hell, I'm gonna let the codebase be unoptimized and ugly until I can get a decent chunk of the game complete.
